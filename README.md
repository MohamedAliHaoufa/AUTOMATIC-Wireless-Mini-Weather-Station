# AUTOMATIC-Wireless-Mini-Weather-Station
This project's major objective is to design and implement an economic wireless embedded system that serves as a mini weather station. I developed my own IoT interface where I displayed all the essential information with a graphical chart representation for better data visualization. I also created a minimal prototype using ESP32 that works properly and meets the necessary demands of this project.
